# Forest Mock Website [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3ffc8007-a575-4008-81c6-c4d30555c44f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/digital-designer-mock-site/deploys)

#### Hello! This repo is part of a multi-part mock website series in which I try to simulate existing websites to brush up on my UX/UII design skills. These will mostly be done in basic HTML, CSS, Figma Wireframes, and a touch of JS if needed. I will also be incorporating tools I'm learning from Kevin Powell's CSS Demystified course and Nashville Software School's Front-End and UX/UI Product courses. Enjoy!
