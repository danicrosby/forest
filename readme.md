# Forest Website Mock V1

### Hello! This repo is part of a multi-part mock website series in which I try to simulate existing websites to brush up on my UX/UII design skills. These will mostly be done in basic HTML, CSS, Figma Wireframes, and a touch of JS if needed. I will also be incorporating tools I'm learning from Kevin Powell's CSS Demystified course and Nashville Software School's Front-End and UX/UI Product courses. The original design is labeled 'designMock'. Enjoy!

### V2 will be responsive using Bootstrap
